# My Portfolio

Building a [website](https://jlcd.de) to display my achievements and show my progress.

## About this website

Since I love playing with new tech, I wanted a reason to play with Three.js.
This ended in the [Experimental](https://jlcd.de/de/experimental) version of this website.
While developing this, I noticed some bugs that I am not able to fix with my current knowledge.
I decided to develop a website alongside this which is now the [Stable](https://jlcd.de/de/stable) version, where I used my knowledge to build a basic responsive website.

## Tech used

### Experimental

- JQuery
- Three.js

### Stable

- JQuery

## Why no framework?

I believe that frameworks aren't needed for everything.
On the same note, I wanted to stay "fresh" so that I am not locked into any ecosystem.

## Sidenotes

### Experimental

#### What have I learned?

- the basics of three.js
- displaying content using the CSS3D library
- problems with responsive 3D design
- limitations of CSS3D

#### What do I want to change?

This is my sandbox. with that in mind, I will test my newly gained knowledge on this website.

### Stable

#### What have I learned?

- using metadata to spice up your website
- responsive web design
- using abstraction in javascript
- working with scss

#### What do I want to change?

- using ES6 modules
